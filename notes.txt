* bonus points for 5 or 6 in a row
* bonus points for 1-move? Maybe 2pts for 1 move, 1pt for normal
* controller support
* 6-in-a-row blows away everything of that color/shape & doesn't replace with that color/shape, effectively reducing the pattern/color count (but they will eventually come back)
  * but only if it's in 1 or 2 moves
* instead of swapping two, shift the whole row and move the end one
* animate the row-shifting so it's not so hard to grok
* like dr mario, two sides work simultaneously on the same puzzle
* something that shows a streak of 2-move matches?

* * *

* get rid of confusing # of moves, just record how many moves it takes & award points accordingly
* move simultaneously, no turns

Add a timer for both players

Give a time-and-move bonus for 5-in-a-row, double for 6-in-a-row.

It's odd to have one player finish so much faster than another...
   can we "meter out" the moves or something?
   or give an infinite number of moves, but track them & subtract them from the points?

The game should end at the same time for all players, I think...
  maybe the # of moves is rationed out based on the amount of time left?

Order of players:

Loop through each Controller (if any)

then mouse
then keyboard

* * *

Wait until a mouse move / arrow-key move / controller-move to throw a has_moved & display the selection box
Wait until a player has made a selection to throw a has_selected boolean & display the score
